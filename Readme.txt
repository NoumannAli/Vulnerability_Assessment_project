Project Outcome: The project outcome was to perform network assessment and to find vulnerability in the network create network security plans generate assessment reports and patch all network flaws. 

Project Overview:  In this project I have performed vulnerability assessment to generate vulnerability reports. The purpose of the vulnerability report is to gain access to company’s system and identify weaknesses, strengths, and areas for improvement. In a digital world, it is more critical than ever to ensure a network is a secure as it can be. This vulnerability report serves as means hardening security posture as needed from an outside perspective. Ultimately this report is a suggestion for how the company can improve the network, but it is up to the company to implement and maintain these changes as well ass finding alternate ways to stay secure.

Justification: The tools were given to me helped me to run through various tasks such as, checking for any unnecessary open ports, check for any anti-virus software, and monitor traffic on open ports. These tasks helped identify areas of vulnerability and how these weaknesses can be circumvented. Essentially the methods used were a detailed step-by-step process through the system to assist the company in maintaining a better security posture. Overall, the company maintains healthy security posture. The main weaknesses was using unsecure services for ports, establishing a reputable anti-virus software, and sticking to strict patch schedule. While the weaknesses aren’t great threats, these small steps will help to maintain a more secure network.

Reflection/Articulation of Response: In this project I have worked on various different tools like Nmap,WireShark, Anti malware, Firewalls, Nessus Professional, Snort, Metasploit, Kali Linux, Aircrack. I have learned a lot about how to run security check on networks and how to monitor networks. This project helped me to understand how to create assessment reports and create solutions for security flaws in the network. Overall this project gave me real life experience and if I have get a chance to redo this project I would do much better because now I have experienced with all the necessary tools which I have used in this project and I will be better to do well. This artifact set me up for the real world by introducing me to what I may actually face as a network consultant (e.g. aging hardware and improperly configured equipment and miss-trained employees
